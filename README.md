# DT8034 Project 2019
Our cool git for the project in the course DT8034 for applying face-recognition from multiple inputs using Apache Spark.  

**TODO:**

- [x] Set up working Kafka Broker that can produce and consume messages.
- [x] Set up a video-collector that can encode our image and push to Kafka.
- [ ] Set up a Spark Application that can consume messages from our broker.
- [ ] Decode the data within Spark, apply face recognition on small batches and sort by camera-id and timestamp. 
- [ ] Output the data in a Google Cloud Bucket. 


>**UPDATE: TO RUN KAFKA WITH PYTHON SPARK VERSION MATCHING IS NEEDED**  
We are currently running Kafka V2.1.1 in the google cloud cluster. To use python as our consumer we need **Kafka verion 0.8** and **Spark verion 2.2.0**


## Kafka
Currently running on a single node (might need to change to cluster)

**Kafka version:** [2.1.1] 

**IP:** 34.90.40.186 

**PORT**: 9092 (ZooKeeper port 2181) 
	


## video-stream-collector

This component will handle data collection from file or camera and push the data to our Kafka endpoint. This serves as our **producer**. 

## video-stream-processor

This component will handle the processing of the data and serves as our **consumer**. It will be running as a Spark application and **subscribe** to our kafka topic, process the data in smaller batches and output it to our bucket. 

## utils

This component only contains some simple scripts to consume/produce message in our Kafka Broker.
